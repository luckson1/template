# React Advanced Patterns

## Core Guidelines
- Use Server Components by default; Client Components only when necessary
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic across components
- Always use `??` over `||` for default values (preserves `false`/`0`/`''`)
- Leverage React Suspense for loading states
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
