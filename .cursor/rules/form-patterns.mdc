# Form Handling Patterns

## Core Guidelines
- Always use React Hook Form for form state management
- Use Zod for form validation schemas
- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) over OR (`||`) for default values
- Implement proper type safety with `zodResolver`
- Handle form submission states (loading, error, success)
