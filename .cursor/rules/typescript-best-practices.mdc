- Enable `strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json` for enhanced type checking
- Use `readonly` arrays and tuples to prevent unintended mutations
- Implement custom type guards for more precise type narrowing
- Utilize mapped types and conditional types for advanced type manipulation
- Use `satisfies` operator to ensure type compatibility without losing type information
