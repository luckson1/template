# Package Management Patterns

## Core Guidelines
- Use `pnpm` as the primary package manager for the project
- Use `pnpm dlx` instead of `npx` for one-off package execution
- Leverage pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Use exact versions in `package.json` for better reproducibility
- Maintain a clean dependency tree with proper peer dependencies
